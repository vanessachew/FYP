On Sundays there is a special brunch menu which for £45 you can eat as much as you want from the feasting table (salads seafood and meats) plus unlimited Bloody Marys Bucks Fizzes and tea or coffee. It was the Sunday Brunch that we sampled and there was a really good range of salads such as smoked feta cheese with shaved fennel pomegranate and toasted pistachios; Caesar salad; and hot smoked Scottish salmon with a Niçoise garnish. The Blue Boar’s décor is understandably very five-star hotel-esque – there’s lots of strong oak panelling throughout and it has been styled to cater to the suits working around the corner at the Houses of Parliament. The chicken was very tasty and moist and the combination with the apple really worked. They were all nicely done but the best of the lot was a smoked chicken with Granny Smith apple that was great. The king prawns proved a little mushy and the oysters were a little bland. The seafood bar options were less impressive. In addition to this you can choose a main of your choice.

There is no question that Antique Bar & Bakery is one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken: their food is simply fantastic their dirty ribeye being phenomenal and their bread pudding one of the best I ever had among other things that makes this popular restaurant a visit worth a trip to the mile square city. The second was recently: the experience was totally different as the place was packed and the cuisine seemed overwhelmed with not just the orders from their hungry diners but also the deliveries. As you arrive you pick a menu and a pencil make your selection and then order at the counter. I admit that it spoiled a bit the experience and I missed a bit the atmosphere of our first visit. Antique on 112 definitely captures the spirit of the original restaurant looking like an old diner that survived the decades passing. The menu is brunch all day (they extended the hours to dinner with the same items) with few specials. The first time was during the Holidays a perfect time as many people were traveling. Once you pay they give you an order number made with game cards and you can sit wherever you can. So when they opened Antique at 112 few steps from their restaurant we had to try it. When your food is ready they will bring your food.

Practicalities aside it was also rather nice after having eaten yourself silly to be able to doze off in the car on the way back to town… but more on that later. The best way to approach a weekend of eating indulgence is to have a designated driver someone who is preferably not you.

Canapes included Pissaladière bases with caramelised onion Jersey royal potato & smoked eel duck rilerte and rosti bites with turbot and sea urchin tartare which were fabulous. Confit duck terrines were likewise light and delicate and sumptuous.

My guest was very pleased with the design of the Lalique crystal champagne glasses for example and we both thought the Lalique Brut champagne was actually very good indeed and a superb start to the meal which instantly set a good mood. The £150 tasting had is not cheap but had some very good moments indeed and I would happily come back here and stay when its rooms for staying over are ready (aimed for later in 2023/24). Set within the oldest whiskey distillery in Scotland Lalique is the flagship restaurant which gained a Michelin star in 2022 under the helmsmanship of chef Mark Donald (formerly at No 1 Balmoral Noma Gleneagles and Hibiscus). A nectarine sorbet followed which as a replacement was very good to have albeit quite sweet rather than tart for an opening canapé. Lalique insisted on a quality restaurant which was agreed and the result is a frankly very good venue. Canapes served included the red currant and liver on cocoa biscuit which was a perfect combination of sweet. The design company Lalique bought a large stake in the distillery but only on the condition that the distillery philosophy of tempered sales to maintain highest quality was not changed. As ever this has absolutely no sway on the final food grade but Lalique certainly have adorned the restaurant well. I should firstly mention how stunning the interior design of the restaurant is. The Nori seaweed tart was stunning – bursting with umami and freshness with just a hint of kick.

It also serves a few bar bites where we tried the tempura prawns (5 pieces – £5.95) with a sweet dipping sauce and Poole Bay rock oysters out of the shell (£1.95 each). There is also an elegant bar area where you can caress a few drinks before hitting the restaurant proper. The Chef Patron of Upper Deck Restaurant is Alex Aitken who earned a Michelin star in 1995 with his first restaurant Le Poussin a star that he retained for 14 years. We didn’t get the best weather during our visit but on a sunny day the unobstructed views promises to be nothing less than spectacular. As the name suggests the hotel is perched on the harbour and the hotel’s restaurant Upper Deck opens up onto a patio that leads right to the water’s edge. The restaurant combines country comfort with coastal chic for a relaxing yet stylish atmosphere. There’s a wealth of treasures to explore in the New Forest from gardens to wildlife parks museums to quaint country towns etc. The list of options is endless and Christchurch Harbour Hotel & Spa was a cozy hotel from which to do all this from. The menu is classically British and draws on produce from the local area. Both were delicious and fresh.

Feng Sushi\s signature dish "Scallop Maki to Dive for" @ £7.25 was as delicious as I remember it - the rice was perfectly seasoned and had a delicate but still firm texture. I had a fascinating time as the founder of Feng Sushi showed us how to cut through fillet after fillet of different types of fish and roll the most delectable sushi. There are no crabsticks in sight at Feng Sushi as these are banned Silla opts for real crab meat instead as well as line-caught mackerel sustainable salmon and hand-dived scallops.

The Old Homestead is definitely an institution: located in the famous meatpacking district in New York it is one of the longest continually serving restaurant in the USA that opened in 1868. This restaurant otherwise is like many steakhouses: dark atmosphere with dimmed light wood and leather for a warm and cozy feeling. However one thing they removed from their menu is the truffled Mac & Cheese; they replaced it with a Lobster Mac & Cheese. I think it is a mistake: Mac & Cheese is a great side for a steak house that changes from a regular mash potatoes bland broccolis or fries. Their meat is of great quality perfectly cooked and each time I went I was never deceived. For me it is one of the best Steakhouses in New York and trust me: I tried many. Their filet mignon is awesome but my favorite is the ribeye: juicy with an incredible taste. I would have kept the truffled Mac & Cheese: it was incredibly delicious. But not everybody likes seafood in it. I am drooling just thinking about it.

Menus at the restaurant itself start at a very reasonable €155 for lunch on certain days to set menus of €285 and €385 at the fuller end with a la carte dishes being around the same price as a base entry set-lunch menu in full. As a restaurant within a hotel it has a unique offering to deliver dishes from the 3 Michelin starred restaurant to your hotel room if the restaurant is fully booked on your visit or stay at the Hotel as was the case on my impromptu visit. Whilst it was clear at time of booking that there was no availability in the restaurant (perfectly understandable) a la carte dishes from the main restaurant menu are actually offered for in-room dining to my amazement. The in-room dining was pleasing as one would expect but for the price demanded for the one main dish tried (€145) and hospitality in general it was an experience and stay I cannot recommend or have any wish to repeat. This was actually something I did not know until there so I decided to take advantage of it however it transpired to be one of the poorest experiences I have had at any venue containing a 3 Michelin starred dining experience let alone a Relais & Châteaux hotel having visited nearly a third of the world’s 3 Michelin starred restaurants now. Following a road trip tour of France through Burgundy Macon and Lyon I decided to stay somewhere nice on the way back to the UK as the final stopover prior to a morning drive to Calais. For those wishing to gain the best value of the restaurant it’s clear which one you can opt for if available on chosen day of visit. L’Assiette Champenoise is the only 3 Michelin starred restaurant in the region of Champagne and is set within the suburbs of Reims.

In terms of the dish itself the turbot from Brittany was good quality as one might hope with a wonderful vin jaune frothy sauce (creamed sauce made with dessert wine) and sweet preserved onion. Menus at the restaurant itself start at a very reasonable €155 for lunch on certain days to set menus of €285 and €385 at the fuller end with a la carte dishes being around the same price as a base entry set-lunch menu in full. What was a slight puzzle was to see Heinz tomato ketchup and mayonnaise in little jars provided as well and I was wondering what they would go with best – the salmon the foie gras the beef tartare (which had no chips) or the dessert…. On settling in to the room we were offered to have the electric car put on charge for €25 whether it was on all night or for 5 minutes which is a bit of a strange policy and very much a relative let down when many five star and Relais & Châteaux hotels provide EV charging included for the general premium one is paying to visit. As there was a language barrier I called down to the reception on the phone to help quickly translate this crucial point to the waiter so there was no confusion but the answer gained from the reception was that the waiter was not allowed to leave the cloche in the room and the receptionist could not answer why. One very nice touch from the hotel was that even though we were not able to gain a table the canapés for the restaurant were afforded to us whilst enjoying champagne in the garden. These were enjoyable and intricately made although I was surprised at the lack of foie gras and tuna flavours presented and generally speaking these seemed to represent those within the 1 Michelin starred field certainly not in the same sphere as that experienced at La Vie Germany (now closed) Alinea Chicago Zen Singapore and Geranium Copengahen as quick examples.

But when one considers the very expensive ingredients from Japan used (see all details in the expansion button) and the fact the meal is served on three different levels of a converted Edwardian town house I don’t believe this represents being overpriced; it appeared to be fair /good value just as a luxury car is in its respective tier. It is also a clever move to regulate table turnover and courses for each sitting and table as well as being good variation for the diner (new setting leg stretch and interest levels etc). In the main I enjoyed the creativity finesse and skill on top of these fine ingredients very much and a couple of dishes immensely. I would come back for those moments in a heart beat if I could knowing it is among the best available in the whole region.

The decor is beautifully done and the lunch menu with no drinks came to £46 which for the a la carte and what turned out to be 7 courses at this level I thought was very good value. Just by looking at the canapes and petit fours one can tell the amount of effort going into the menu and bar the pace of the meal I was very pleased with this meal in a venue that clearly deserves its new shiny star. The lunch menu is offered as 2 courses for £30 or 3 courses for £35 with a 5-course tasting menu at £60 and 7-course tasting menu at £70. The menu is innovative Indian food and this lunch of mine proved to be rammed with a selection of fun dishes.

Opheem was opened in late 2018 and gained a Michelin star in 2020. A savoury cookie of strawberry with toasted sesame and madras was fatty with lovely toasted seeds and delicate strawberry.

My main chosen was the ‘day boat catch’ a take on dishes commonly found in Kerala (South Indian state) and in this case was a decent cut of cod.

"With so many versions of ramen in Japan itself its always interesting to see which types of prevailed in America; any time I see a restaurant touting variety Im curious to see how it turns out." What makes Daruma a little different from other ramen spots was that their specialty was in ramen made with whole chicken broth and accompanied by eggless tapioca-based noodles. Most commonly we see pork bone bases for broths and iconic yellow flour noodles so this was a change of pace. Daruma on 6th Street happened to be on my list of places to check out particularly because they are a ramen shop that has a less common type of method to their dishes. A hot afternoon walking around downtown Austin somehow made us crave ramen. They boast making their bases and stock every day and their menu focuses on the lightness of the broth. The inside of this restaurant is quite cozy as is the case with most ramen shops. The bar seating allowed diners ourselves included to watch the cooks make up the dishes as orders were placed.

The crab cake packed with local Jersey crab of course was coated in a crunchy golden crumb and surrounded by chunks of well-cooked squid which cut through like soft butter. Enjoying panoramic views of the bay from our table we started our evening with a celebratory glass of bubbles a bottle of my favourite Viognier wine and this starter of Buffalo mozzarella salad with roasted figs sweet & sour walnuts and watercress. I loved the delicate tingle of chilli and tamarind flavours in this dish too – two ingredients which can do no wrong when crab is involved. The mozzarella was oh-so creamy the figs were sweet and smokey the walnuts added both texture and flavour – while that watercress offered a little spiciness. Located on the gorgeous St Brelade’s Bay on the south-west part of the Island this is one restaurant everyone should add to their must visit list – especially for those sea views. The seafood is some of the finest you’ll ever come across the meats are always delicious and the vegetables when they come into season can rival some of the best in the world. I’ve said it many times before but having visited Jersey four times now – not once have I ever experienced a bad meal on this beautiful island. Showcasing the best that Jersey has to offer is a restaurant we recently fell in love with from our Winter escape to Jersey – Oyster Box Beach Bar & Restaurant. Second of our starters and arguably the winner was this crab cake with chilli salt squid tomato and tamarind chutney. Every single item on this plate was packed with flavour which made for such a satisfying dish.

The £181 for one (with sake) dinner price tag was more digestible than most high-end Kaseiki restaurants in Japan and although it was a good experience to explore Osaka there were not enough high-end moments to making me want to leap back for a return visit here. Frequent readers of mine will know that I have no qualms in saying whether I believe Michelin are pitching too high or low on a verdict but in this case I very much agree that this experience did not merit the ultimate accolade certainly nowhere near the comparison to Kitcho or Mizai and sadly I actually questioned whether the 2 stars was generous. At the time of my visit this restaurant was graded as a 3 Michelin starred restaurant but in a follow-up it lost a star in the 2020 guide two months later. This restaurant is run by head chef Shintaro Matsuo who was friendly but could not engage too much with diners owing to the language barrier. What was a nice touch was his staff members running around the restaurant showing pictures of the fish and produce all were eating on an iPad and explaining where possible. Bonito with aubergine and roe sauce was our first bite (the same menu given to all diners at the same time) and this was a pleasurable snack. You could do a lot worse of course and this would serve as a useful ‘beginner’ Kaiseki venue. In 2020 the Michelin guide pronounced three 3 Michelin starred restaurants within Osaka (Hajime Taian and Kashiwaya). Koryu now slips into the 2 Michelin starred family of which there are an impressive 15 restaurants of this category in Osaka alone.

The £181 for one (with sake) dinner price tag was more digestible than most high-end Kaiseiki restaurants in Japan and although it was a good experience to explore Osaka there were not enough high-end moments to making me want to leap back for a return visit here. At the time of my visit this restaurant was graded as a 3 Michelin starred restaurant but in a follow-up it lost a star in the 2020 guide two months later. Crab with vinegar jelly shiitake mushroom and berries was wonderful – a light sweetness to the jelly with beautifully smoked mushroom and very well done. The tuna with slow-cooked egg yolk wasabi and soy was one of the rare stunning moments of this though. The sashimi platter was beautifully presented and included yellowfin with egg yolk herring squid with plum sauce beef noodle snapper and shrimp and purified saltwater. The squid was lovely with plum sauce but texturally was quite hard and not as massaged as it was in Mizai (bit hard in comparison) by a long shot. In 2020 the Michelin guide pronounced three 3 Michelin starred restaurants within Osaka (Hajime Taian and Kashiwaya). Koryu now slips into the 2 Michelin starred family of which there are an impressive 15 restaurants of this category in Osaka alone. Before all diners received their appetisers several large shrimps heads were placed on a grill to gently cook the brains. The soup contained grouper and matsutake mushrooms (very chewy but with a strong mushroom aroma).

The wonderful thing about this restaurant is that while its food may be of the tapa style its dishes and inspiration are taken from across the globe – we ate dishes here from Greece Spain and Italy in one sitting alone. Since the last time I was here I’ve already seen an Italian restaurant named Scusi close down – a shame because it had such good potential but its pricing was all wrong. Every single time I come back to Maastricht there seems to always be a new restaurant opening up just around the corner from another. The manager runs around the restaurant belting out operatic tunes and the head chef occasionally joins in while grilling an array of seafood delights. None of my photos really show off the true size of any of the dishes but I can assure you they were large. Inside it’s warm and cosy full of character and charm but most importantly – the food is delicious and very plentiful. A huge chalk board shows off the specials while the main menu and a surprise option for 30 euros leaves a lot to be decided when choosing food here. At this point we had no idea how much food we we’re to be eating little did we know we were in for a very big surprise. Fresh off the plane and incredibly hungry we decided to go for that surprise menu. On the same street where Scusi once was a new(ish) addition has arrived Taverna La Vaca.

This is simple home cooking at its finest and you really do feel relaxed eating here it’s like an oasis – but with lots of good affordable wine – regularly topped up. Since the last time I was here I’ve already seen an Italian restaurant named Scusi close down – a shame because it had such good potential but its pricing was all wrong. Every single time I come back to Maastricht there seems to always be a new restaurant opening up just around the corner from another. The one thing to remember about the food here at Taverna La Vaca is that it’s all very simple relaxed and very simply cooked but of the most amazing quality and packed with huge flavours. By the time meat courses arrived we already had no room for anything else but we didn’t stop – yet. When filling dishes such as this risotto arrived at the table we knew there was no chance in us leaving without feeling incredibly full. It was honestly cooked to such a sheer perfection I can’t remember the last time I’ve had squid as tender as this piece was. The wine had taken its toll by this point too I seemed to be guzzling it like water. Special commendation goes out to this huge piece of grilled and smoky squid. The surprises kept on coming out large and fast.

As this was a fairly full-on dining holiday (approximately 21 Michelin stars in the month) we opted for the 5 course menu knowing full well this ‘lower’ version would make us perfectly full and end up providing us with multiple treats from here regardless. This lunch with drinks came to £210 per person which for the whole occasion seemed fair although this was one of the smaller menus available and you could spend a great deal more if you find yourself being more care-free. This was a stylish lunch in every way with excellent service although the design of the interior is a bit over the top for my personal taste. The food was a delight though I was very pleased to see and sent me back to my visit of Joel Robuchon’s ex-3 Michelin starred flagship restaurant in Las Vegas. It has been built stone by stone in homage to Moulinsart a company that has been set up to protect the work of Hergé (creator of Tintin). The head chef is Michael Michaelidis and this lunch visit was on the brand’s extended 25th anniversary year of Louix XV’s opening in Monaco. Still Menu C is not cheap in itself and is roughly the price of the more expensive tasting menus in London but this is a 3 Michelin starred Chatueix in Tokyo so this was always going to be the case. Three lunch menus were presented: Menu ‘A’ (7 courses) at 30000 JPY (£209pp) Menu ‘B’ (7 courses but less choice) at 25000 JPY (£174) and Menu ‘C’ (5 courses) at 18000 JPY (£125). However as sure as mustard the treats began pouring out. Châteaux Restaurant Joël Robuchon is set in the Yebisu Gardens of Tokyo.

Everything about this dish worked and the true hero was actually the jelly but the indulgent textures and flavours were beautiful and this is a dish that was as good as it looked. This was a stylish lunch in every way with excellent service although the design of the interior is a bit over the top for my personal taste. Pumpkin soup was made with butternut pumpkin which has very sweet seeds and came with smoked duck served on an onion custard flan. The caviar dish was a signature dish and visually spectacular. The vast array of breads was another lovely reminder of Las Vegas and the bread trolley alone was a wonder. The other starter was aubergine with cep caviar with cumin espelette chilli and parmesan shavings which was nicely done. Still Menu C is not cheap in itself and is roughly the price of the more expensive tasting menus in London but this is a 3 Michelin starred Chatueix in Tokyo so this was always going to be the case. The amuse bouche was a scampi sea urchin and béchamel toasted stick and the reminder of this is literally making me salivate as I write.

The meal began with canapés of a thin parmesan waffle which was extraordinarily light and cheesy an aloe vera mousse with edible sweet wrapper which was not my favourite flavour a mini pizza stick with mozzarella mushroom thyme which was absolutely loaded with mushroom flavour and tartlet of Artichokes. The bread was made in house and among the choices were brown baguette and cereal brioche with Brittany butter – both were of a pedigree standard of baking and churned Brittany butter which is coincidentally the broth place of the head chef. The amuse bouche was a cep jelly and cuttlefish mix which had absolutely stunning smokiness and a pure jelly vinegar balance – a lovely and light start. The €315 price tag for lunch and wine is actually getting away with things lightly for a Parisian 3-star restaurant but I can’t help thinking that if you were to take someone special here for dinner you may as well put a thousand aside. The head chef is Christian Le Squer who has graced the restaurant with the ultimate accolade since he arrived in 2014 as was clearly the mandate that the luxury hotel banked on when gaining him. One thing’s for sure you will have a very good meal and serious browny points if you ever did this as one of the most romantic and prettiest locations you could possibly have dinner. Le Cinq (The Fifth) is the flagship 3 Michelin starred restaurant set within the absolutely stunning Four Seasons Hotel a short walk off the Champs-Élysées in Paris.

The pasta is beautifully done and aside its obviously impressive design the quality of the ham mushroom and cheese blend with stunning truffled sauce really did make this as good as it looked and was a superlative dish – very pleased to have made sure I have had this as one for the life ticks to ensure.

The main is a signature of the chef and I was aware of this dish prior to arrival and equally keen to try as a staple dish. It is a rectangular tube of pasta comprised of spaghetti strands all joined together to form the shell inside which is a cheese ham and mushroom mix with a truffled sauce costing €135 for one serving.

With only four days in Maastricht eating out every lunch and dinner for a three course meal with amuse bouches and canapés was taking its toll – investing in a box of rennies was a godsend though probably not a great idea. Walking in to ‘t plenske we were warmly greeted and sat in their lovely glass courtyard area – which i’m sure would have much more allure to it in the summer months. Some bread shortly arrived at the table all well cooked but not particularly exciting – the black olive tapenade on the other hand was something special. Still full from yesterdays dinner it was nothing a long bath and half a bottle of champagne (and a couple of rennies) couldn’t sort out. We made our way to ‘t Plenske in the centre of Maastricht for our lunch a charming restaurant serving real hearty French food with a nod towards Italian. For 26.50 euros you’ll be spoilt with two huge course which use top quality ingredients. The clientele were somewhat of an older generation and extremely starey – i felt as though i’d walked into a room naked. We took our seat and ordered a glass of chilled champagne. Lunch here at ‘t Plenske really is a good deal. The first of our starters to arrive was a rillette of juicy stringy venison.

A real winter warmer of a dish were some slabs of well hung Argentine beef steak which were oozing meaty flavour – though a little tough on the occasional bite.

The beer selection and variety is second to none and of course the food – well it’s pretty darn amazing just about everywhere. Husband and wife duo are the brains behind the restaurant with Kevin Bonanno heading up the kitchen while his wife Jolien Fuchs works as general manager overseeing the dining room and looking after diners. With such a huge open dining room and a flood of light coming in it does face a problem of lacking atmosphere unless busy. Stark white walls black furniture and lots of glass – all they’d need is a hot-tub out the back. When visiting I’m always on the hunt for that new restaurant or next Michelin star with the Limburg province alone boasting just shy over 25 Michelin stars which is a huge number for a relatively small(ish) area. I’m not entirely sure when the restaurant was last completely renovated but the decor feels very 1950s Hollywood bachelor pad. The Limburg province of the Netherlands and Flanders region of Belgium are perhaps my favourite places to visit in Europe. So when i heard that a beautiful converted windmill property Al Mulino in Maasmechelen had just been take over i couldn’t wait to head over. The people are among the friendliest you’ll find.

Think lots of woodwork and dining nooks on the ground floor as well as an open bar with seating. This reviewer’s two cents on the debate is simple: when you walk into a venue you know almost instinctively whether or not the vibes are good. The group behind Ambiente has five outlets spread across Yorkshire of which three are located in the county’s eponymous city. Countless column inches have been spent pondering the question of what gives a restaurant atmosphere. Despite being located in the historic centre of York step into Ambiente and you could almost imagine yourself in Spain. The Goodramgate venue which we visited apparently has a more traditional and less industrial feel than the others in its portfolio. Big windows look out onto the street. Upstairs there is a more intimate and cosy dining area. York’s Ambiente a Andalucian-inspired tapas venue hit all the right notes. The colours are aubergine purple and smoke blue.

To the credit of Ambiente it seeks to cater for as broad an audience as possible with its options. Countless column inches have been spent pondering the question of what gives a restaurant atmosphere. First up however for our group was a meat sharing platter.

As is common with almost every tapas venue Gourmand Gunno has visited outside of Spain there were both some inevitable hits and misses across the menu. Big windows look out onto the street. York’s Ambiente an Andalucian-inspired tapas venue hit all the right notes. A comfortable buzz of conversation and movement hummed across both floors. By contrast the pan Catalán was a major disappointment.

Even chefs more highly talented than those working at dim-t might struggle to execute successfully offerings as varied as Indonesian nasi-goreng Thai red curry and Korean fried chicken. Dim-t (why an additional letter is appended to the name is utterly unclear) has evolved from its original steamed dumpling dim-sum proposition to offering what is billed as “a taste of Asia.” The term is patronising. These conditions would only be satisfied were the customer a Brit with little experience of real Asian food. There is no such thing as a taste of Europe so why assume so for a much bigger landmass? He and his dining comrade visited the Hampstead original and were mostly disappointed from start to finish. How Dim-t has endured for since the mid-2000s and expanded into a mini chain of half a dozen outlets is an absolute mystery to this reviewer. The restaurant trade is Darwinian. And they had low expectations at the outset too. To describe your dishes which dim-t does as “authentic traditional delicious” constitutes a misnomer on all counts. Only the fittest should survive.


ChatGPT Summary:
Dim-t has evolved from its original steamed dumpling dim-sum proposition to offering what is billed as “a taste of Asia.” To describe your dishes which dim-t does as “authentic traditional delicious” constitutes a misnomer on all counts. Crispy aromatic duck was certainly crispy if less aromatic than we might have liked. The presence of the latter obviously helps boost the venue’s margins but clearly reduces the pleasure for guests when consuming the dish. Despite having asked whether we could mix and match across fillings we were told no this was not possible. A snacking dish of prawn crackers with which we were initially presented was stale. Our evening in Hampstead began inauspiciously with the staff having no record of our booking. The restaurant trade is Darwinian. Only the fittest should survive. Dim-t somewhat redeemed itself with the mains and dessert. It did not improve much.

The venue – which is easy to miss unless you’re looking for it – was opened on Berners Street in one of the brief windows of normality during the pandemic. It also provides a fertile ground for experimentation where even more seasoned and sceptical diners such as your reviewer can be impressed. They are to put their faith in the hands of head chef Aji Akokomi. Intrepid diners constantly want to be surprised by the novel to boast that they are eating cutting-edge boundary-pushing cuisine. With the world fortuitously having left the COVID era behind Akoko has truly found its feet. It’s a difficult feat for any restaurateur to pull off. The sub-Saharan African dining scene especially at the high-end has been long-neglected in London. Diners are not given a choice on arrival. Getting a booking there now is increasingly hard. Look no further than Akoko.

Such is the passion of the team at Akoko that ahead of the jollof rice dish being brought to our table we were left with a small booklet explaining its significance in West African culinary culture.

Intrepid diners constantly want to be surprised by the novel to boast that they are eating cutting-edge boundary-pushing cuisine. Akokomi and his team draw on influences from across West Africa.
